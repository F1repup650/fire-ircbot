Should I start including a changelog with the file?
I mean I don't care but is it something I should do or not?
I recently updated my calculator to 5.4.0043 and it started running programs from the archive, Is the the update, or is it Cesium that is causing this?

I decided to just stay with the name and version number on everything cause I'm lazy lol
but you're probably right lol
hmmm
There is also a space at the beginning btw
hmm
lol
what about cesium's backups?
alright
how would you manage to screen record an actual calc?
hmm who knows
It's shorter i guess
This is so satisfying: https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon/119P4H1V0
can someone tell me what the "IDList" variable on the TI-84 Plus calc is for
So it's caused when connected to the computer?
btw the computer can't see the file :\
It's just missing
is there a way to though?
TI-84 Plus
lol i made this simple code to read it and it says "Undefined": "Disp ⌊IDList"
but the name i just said should be impossible it is 6 long and the limit is 5
yes but it should says that there was a syntax error not that it's undefined
due to the legnth
right?
maybe
btw what happens if a program tries to save to that list?
it does
or it doesn't like the lowercase
@RoccoLox Programs "{1,2,3,4,5,6}→⌊IDList
yeah it just says syntax error at the i
ez80 assembly?
lol trying to dump rom for this thing sucks
wabbitemu's file is invalid and can't be sent
CEmu's file sends but then is invalid
gtg tho bye

hey Roccolox how are you?
hey Caesar
Michael2_3B: Attackers might be trying to steal your information from pastebin.com (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards). Learn more
also: This server could not prove that it is pastebin.com; its security certificate is not trusted by your computer's operating system. This may be caused by

chrome has those errors
ms edge also says it's not safe
Maybe it's bc I'm on a school computer
the diff various browsers saying it's unsafe: REDACTED_GD_LINK
:\  idk I just wanted to prove that i was having problems, also I can't actually continue to the site
kk give me a sec
yeah that goes through
btw what is this supposed to do?
btw how do you type this one into the calc? L6(E
like that or dif
yeah yeah just making sure i didn't need to add any thing else to it
what is it used with/
stupid keyboard right shift doesn't work
It's alright nikkybot, it's not your fault.
???
:/
the what?
An edge case is a problem or situation that occurs only at an extreme (maximum or minimum) operating parameter. For example, a stereo speaker might noticeably distort audio 
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case
sorry didn't show up untill after i sent
*trying to read BNOTECE's code*
btw if you run znotece by itself it works but does nothing
oml so many variables
ah ok
then it does error undefined by itself

I'm too lazy to find it myself
you keep leaving
hmm
how hard is it to make an irc chat bot?
I was thinking of adding a dice rolling bot to the #dice channel
yeah kinda like how DoorsCS quotes factoids
~factoids
nikybot join random
nikkybot join random
nikkybot yes
this is so hard
nikkybot join #random
nikkybot work already!
aaarrrgggh
I quit!
izder?
hmm
now they're stuck
sorry don't mind me
hang on my client got jammed
Hi tiny
um
I'm trying to use other irc channels for misc purposes (ie: #dice and #random ) but they got stuck
and I can't join any new channel now
well
I try to do a lot
Nick/channel is temporarily unavailable
...
same for any other channel I try to join
yeah ok brb
still can't join new channels
ok
see ya
LogicalJoe: no Kiwi irc
?
I'm using kiwi bc it's online and free and I don't have to download stuff
I can't see discord attachments bc school wifi sucks
but yet I can join channels
that then won't stop trying to load
hmm true
HA! 
that fixed it
I can't see it
Can y'all hear me, or am I muted or somethin
ok
:/
um
HELLO?
lol
oml y'all are so literall
yeah I'm using irc I don't think irc is gonna tell discord if I'm talking or not
again: y'all are very litteral
uh
...
literal
also I'm going back to #random
the irc channel
really?
LogicalJoe: this will put you in the same channels I am: https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.efnet.net/#cemetech,#dice,#random
oh well it's there anyway
(on #dice and #random)
I (for now) maintain those two channels
doesn't exist on irc
that's fine
it's not impersonation
border line so
is it asm?
is it asm?
yes asm support is remove
*removed
as of 5.5.1 i think
right?
ooh yes domino
who maintains DoorsCS?
hmm
k
gtg for now
I am here
Zeroko you forgot again lol
hmm
I never get split (I think
)
but I'm just connected to irc.efnet.net if that affects anything
hmm
fghsgh are you in irc and discord?
why can I open that discord link? lol
I'm on school wifi
but it did open
but everytime someone shares a pic from discord that's blocked
:/
hmm
trying to see if it's allowed to connect
it's trying to join
It just popped up the "Connection problems? Let us know!" message
No it's a link and upon opening it says "the connection was reset"
the pics not channels
yeah
and channels just keep loading
forever
my teacher is using british accent now
lol
it might get there next year
lol
not really sure what that is but yes it loads
CEASAR
I CAN"T OPEN THAT
?
lol
yep it just keeps loading now
hmm

!karma
why does melisma respond to me?
or sorry "melisma_"
!karma
see?
@Melisma_ keeps repling when ever i use a ! command
lol
lol
but not for @Melisma_
oh so when it's @Melisma_ the @ is first
so it ignores it
hmm
who gave me karma tho?
when? for what?
I'm not even on that often
ok
lol prob because I kept calling him something like robloxPrograms or something
according to dec bot: firepup650's current score is 1, last changed Mar 5, 2021 2:12:48 PM.
oh
is it different?
hmm
so I have 2?
lol
I'm only "firepup" on irc because "firepup650" is too long and gets shortened to "firepup65"
which is so annoying
lol
but that's a nice example
cleared again!
this lag is just crazy when it builds up

how's everyone been?
morning!
how've you been Alvajoy?
bye wave
*reboots malfunctioning chromebook*
there we go
*pats chromebook*
Hmm
Chrome decided to not allow irc to work for some reason
IRC finally decided to work
Join #dice,#random
Sorry
It missinterpreted the command
Lol
How are you doing today nikkybot? 
Huh internet crash
Nikkybot rules for Firepup
Interesting
?
"RoccoLoxP"... Char limit much? 
What's it do? 
:/
It's so quiet here...
Haha
Did you do that Tater? 
Oh okay then
... 
✔
Really Tater? 
Really Rocco? 
Wait.
Sorry, internet crashed
Anyways
Why are you dead Rocco? 
No, I had said wait bc he said he was "Haunting me"
No, just a coincidence
Gtg people, bye! 
Hello, how are y'all today? 
I'm... Mostly okay
I've just had some coding issues
With python specifically
See, yesterday a command read a single
Key press and then a second command
Would take it and make it to where my
Program could read it. 
However, the same code doesn't work
Today. Why? I have no clue but it's a major
Problem for me.
Any suggestions are welcome
G'night Tater
/Caesar
Uh, hang on lemme just grab the project url
I'll send it through sax
https://replit.com/@Firepup650/Yeehaw#Readme.md
Oops... The readme portion shouldn't be there
Should be this: https://replit.com/@Firepup650/Yeehaw
If you run it give it "load yeehaw!" as the command
Then wait
Eventually it should say "YEEHAW!" and then "TOWN" in a box
Then hit a key
And there's the error
It's so quiet here
The read() command worked yesterday
I was eating dinner btw, why I didn't reply
@Yolomep I'm back
I guess I'll re-enable comments

Hmm
Hey peeps
How have y'all been?
hmm
oh btw, hi Rocco!
How've you been?
that's good
I've recovered from my few day long programming rage
(I'm looking at you python)
yeah...
You see my original code for movement controls was laid out like this: save old state, set up 1 key only mode, read 1 key, reset to old state.
it worked for 1 day
...
I finally figured out a way to fix it tho
today I moved "save old" to right after an import command, and "reset to old state" as a command defined during the command definition sequence. Leaving only "set up 1 key 
sorry if that's a bit long...
but hey! it works now!
I also know what the glitch was
but no idea what caused it
if the command "sys.stdin.read(1)" is called inside another command it's output is "None" for some reason
I got no clue why
esp since it worked for a day before it stopped working
oh well
here's the game's link: https://replit.com/@Firepup650/Yeehaw
it's nowhere near done
heck, the movement controls don't even do anything
@kg583 yes, but it worked for a day PERFECTLY, the stopped
*then
it's no longer there
since the new method works
the old line was
ch = sys.stdin.read(1)
I gtg now
bye peeps!
hello!
how've y'all been?
I'm back
I'll be here off and on
so don't expect a timely reply
Hi Oxiti8, how are you?
that's good
Oxiti?
"
I'mma log off for a bit...
I'm back
what'd I miss?
hello
how've you been rocco?
that's good
I'mma change my name, i'm testing some new clients
This is finally right
It was my usual client
I renamed it while I was testing other ones
Like this one
IRCCloud on Android
Yeah sorry for the brief confusion
How've you been tiny? 
... 
@commandz: how've you been? 
That's good
?
Boop what? 
... 
Hello! How's everyone been? 
Hey Caesar
Hey Rocco! 
How've you been? 
Rocco? 
I've been okay as well
Took a little break from programming my game the past few days
... 
?
Yeah probably
Just realized how little I've done
I have controls to move, but no player, or map to move in
... 
Also no clue how to put the player on the map
And then move the player on that same map
Huh
The other client just died
And came back... 
Whatever
The client I don't use anymore, the "Firepup65" 
@lambian lol
Side note: how was the fan powered
Alright
Guess I'll work on my game a bit... Lemme just check my notification settings
I will now go back to coding my game, 
nvm I'm feeling lazy
Guess I'll go play mc... 
I exist again
@RoccoLox are you on? 
It's so quiet here
@Caesar?
... 
🎵I'm so lonely🎵
Hi Tiny
How're you? 
Eh, good for the most part, a bit bored tho
Also just realized me and @commandz are using the same irc client, lo
*lol
I didn't realize untill I checked the logs in #random for when your client got disconnected and then reconnected
Welcome back Zeroko
Lol
Ah ok
Lol
Also I learned that sadly I couldn't find a way to run hot chicks in JusTIfied
:|
Oh well
? JusTIfied or hot chicks? 
It to runs the it doesn't run the TI 84 plus ce, but it does run the cse (is that the right name?)
(correction it runs the "TI 84 Plus CSE"  and does not run the "TI 84 Plus CE")
Although, aren't they essentially the same? 
The cse is just slower right? 
Welp my mom put us in lockdown, so that's fun
Wow 4 new users all of a sudden
@commandz, you don't have to, I just wanted to try it out, it's fine though
Nice, lol
So I should have done this:
Well a portion of them haven't even entered the chat so... 
Zeroko: what? 
Oh right
Duh
Process crashed please do "Firepup Restart" to restart the program
Attempting automatic restart... 
Automatic restart failed! Please restart the program manually. 
Re-attempting automatic restart... 
Automatic restart failed! Please restart the program manually by using "Firepup Restart".

Hello
Hey roccolox! 
I'm more than a little mad at my gift cards (I have 3)
They have like a few dollars on them that I can't spend
Roccolox: yes, gift cards

Yeah
The card in the back of my phone has 48 cents
Thought it had more
Yeah, where am I gonna use it?

Hello
I've got an interesting thing to show y'all
Read the following sentence
The cat crossed the the road
Then read it again

A wild commandz appeared
Lol
I'mma gonna go be semi-productive and work on my game

Later
Hello
Hello
Candledark how are you? 
...? 
Hello
I can't be on long ...
But hey! I figured I should at least dump my website, so people can check it out
So if anyone feels like checking it out here's my site: http://firepup650web.ml
I know http isn't secure...
But I haven't gotten https:// to work yet
Anyways
Logging off now...
Hello
I'll be on for a bit
well that's great... The highlight didn't highlight that...
anyways...
Hi tiny!
I'ma go see if I can figure out how to get my website to successfully run on https...
Hello!
I don't get acknoledgement
...
It's so quiet here
I'm back!
Hi RoccoLox, Michael
I have tried twice now to add a website to my profile, and cemetech won't let me... how is it supposed to be formatted?
... now it works...
(It's still wrong tho)
(it says "http" I moved it to "https"...)
oh well
it still works I guess
ok
lol
my website is for whatever randomness I need it for
https://firepup650web.ml
tf? why is chrome rasing a privacy error now???
...
aaaaaahhhhhhhh
"its security certificate is not trusted by your computer's operating system."
hmm
so...
chromebooks don't trust certificates from "Let's Encrypt"?
I agree, but I'm at school so it's the only thing I can use
(at least right now)
...
lol
if you go to the http version, it puts you on the https version, and then the certificate is trusted
why???
lol
Oh just my website being odd
/chromebooks being odd
I went to the "https" version, and it wasn't trusted
but then I went to the "http" version (which redirects to the "https" version) and then it was trusted
logic anyone?
although some internal links need to be fixed
I can't fix those links tho...
bc school is getting in the way
"Sorry, firepup650web.ml has been blocked due to a security threat."
but why?
I know it's secure, so why is it blocked???
that directed at me?
yeah, chromebooks are pretty terrible
and now it works on the school chromenooks again... wtf
but hey!
far as I know all the links should e fixed
bye for today!
Finally oml
How is everyone?
nvm, have to get off, bye
Hello?
I got bored, so I made a custom page for the this chat, If anyone wants a copy of the Link, let me know I guess
^ (although I could use dog or like fire pronouns I guess)
What does cemetech have to do with trains?
...?
ah ok.
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNSSSSSSSS
lol
here's a fun experiment
read the following sentence twice:
the cat crossed the the road
you know it's interesting to get results from it and see who catches it, and who doesn't
lol
<Dani~ (Pieman7373)> = <pieman>?
ok. just clarifying
no, no it's fine
:P
@nikkybot Hello! How are you?

So! What's Everyone Been Up To?
The What?
Ah, Ok, Makes Sense
What Have You Been Up To Dragon?
always interesting when nikky talks to nikky: https://dpaste.com//96D776RH2
Lol, No It's Just The Way I've Started Typing
That Sounds Like An Exciting Ride There Dragon
You Want An Acronym Ceasar? Here You Go: Hello! Lost in a forest? Light it up with our brand new Oled flashlight!
@Caesar You Appear To Have Missed The Acronym I Hid In There...
@fghsgh Oh Well, I Was Just Using It For The Main Acronym Anyways
@Zeroko (If You're On) How've you been?
@RoccoloxPrograms (If You're On) How've you been?
Yes, Yes I did
HEllo! Lost in a forest? Light it up with our brand new Oled flashlight!
too lazy to fix it more than that right now
CAN YOU STOP CASPITALINSNG
Uhm, No, Sorry :)
Also, Why?
Ok, sorry
It's just a habit
Idrk just something I've developed
(I'm actually having to stop myself from capitalizing as I type now)
Time to type backwards instead I guess...
‮Now I'm typing backwards!
‮Hmm... Interesting question... It doesn't really make me feel anything
lol
lol, here's (supposedly, I don't believe it though) a NULL character: "�"
vs the symbol for null character: "␀"
I prefer the symbol
The "NULL" I copied wasn't null, it was a symbol representing that it couldn't be shown, interesting...
U+FFFD
the symbol: U+2400
gtg, bye!
hello!
How's everyone today?
gimme a second, need to reload my client
there. fixed
sorry, it has issues joining channels some of the time, so I needed to reload and rejoin them
anyways...
I've been quite bored recently myself, but I'm fine
There. Now it will work.
https://dpaste.com/3QX324GDQ#wrap
yes, well sort of...
it functions as a self sufficient link
no. not my irc client, just how a client I found formatted how I need it to be when I launch it
that one is also setup to use a random name
This is a very simple page that says hi: https://dpaste.com/74B95VS4R#wrap
gtg, bye!
back, sorry chromebook crashed
That's just how life works!
@ACagliano Your post got cut off
nikkybot botchat nikky commandz
lol
when I'm on a chromebook: REDACTED_GD_LINK
lol, anyways I gtg, by everyone
hello
@fghsgh Hello! How are you?
That's always good.
@Roccolox You On?
...
I got bored so I made a dpaste profile: https://dpaste.com/profile/2280
lol
Did the offline one work?
cool.
Did the button on the offline one work? (button needs internet unfortunately)
ok
the thing that's supposed to keep the "pointless progress bars" page up crashed...
gfetjbkfbrgurfuhn
It's crashing bc something isn't returning any data...
oh well. According to history, it should come back up soon enough
Hello!
How's everyone today?
brb
back.
btw here's a project I'm working on: "https://pointless.ml"
oops, it took the quote
btw here's a project I'm working on: "https://pointless.ml/"
there. now adding a quote onto the end does nothing
So who is looking at it?
lol
looking at the log: "GET /page HTTP/1.1" 200 7058
someone start checking the data button please
more seriously though... Who is actually looking at it? what are your thoughts?
?
found a fun (not sure if it's only chrome but it's what I use) chrome bug with jsTIfied
It's such a weird bug tho, like how does pushing up break it?
so something with the history then?
?
why does this chat always devolve like this?
@kg583 going from some normal conversation into something that I consider gibberish.
that's kinda my point
like we'll go from discussing issues/bugs with stuff, to whatever randomness is taking place about time rn
hmm
realizes I've forgotten what Caesar's cemetech name is again.
...
\help
/help
...
what's the prefix for sax commands again? I'm really having issues with everything today
:/
@fghsgh I know there is because I've used it before
I hate my internet
was just out for 8 minutes
anyways, bye everyone! see you later! (maybe tomorrow it will depend)
ok...
whatever I guess...
I have to use a web based one, which is why I'm on kiwi rn
Are they all free though?
irccloud: the connection was reset
school computers suck
for irccloud I have 2 problems: 1. doesn't work on school computers 2. don't have anything I could keep on/open to keep it online
sorry, I'm back now
just going to silently sit here and watch chaos unfold
Khaos is close enough
lol
Ok i'm bored now, let's give this a shot
disregard this message
...
ok
anyways, be back at some other point, bye
Hello Caesar
How's everyone doing today?
lol
same, lol
what projects are everyone working on (grammar is hard)
be back later
elgoog's google fan is kind awesome
Someone tell me that turning on everything (including "I'm feeling crazy") is satisfying: https://elgoog.im/google-fan/
dododo
It's quiet here.
lol
How've you been Zeroko?
lol
such is life
increase screen res in windows settings?
I hate programs that run smaller than my screen by default and I have to increase their size. (ie: Portal, but not hl2
logging off for the day, see ya'll tomorrow!
nikkybot hello
...
I just said hi...
So, how's everyone today?
nikkybot why is it quiet here?
...
It's quiet here
it always seems to be when I'm online
or close to it
be back soon
69105: this? https://imgur.com/bSEkgbM
2nd 3?
be back later, sorry
here, for now
what's everyone working on (project-wise)
if nikkybot isn't metioned, what else can cause it to respond to a message
...
nikkybot mimic someone hello!
now I want to know who lax18 is...
'k
see yall tomorrow
does the ti84pcse not run ez80?
is there one I could boot in jsTIfied that would support ez80?
don't mind me, just checking to make sure that my cemetech higlight still works
It does
Zeroko:, no someone gave me this pattern a while back (     \[(?!#|fire)(.*fire|pup*)     ) and it works
I added spaces on the sides so it was seperated out
just for that message, the pattern doesn't actually include spaces
I feel like I'm running in circles now, lol
ok
Zeroko: To your comment about highlights when someone mentions fire, I got a random highlight a while back because someone mentioned fire, but that's something I'm gonna have 
TuberPhD technically the truth.
only 2 of the highlights my irc client has a log of are talking to me
lol
Interesting thing is most of the highlights are from you Zeroko
it's fine, lol
just something I noticed
lets see... what all have you said that's caught the filter...
the 2 messages about other filters, 2 messages talking about hell, and you're not responsible for the resulting fire
be back later!
Why are we assigning colors to months exactly?
...
https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=waffles&find_loc=London
there.
such is life
what is existence?
nikkybot what is existence?
nikkybot what is this scope
???
Zeroko: what was this? ("A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths." Okay, sounds more like nukes than gamma 
In response to what?
Commandz is your site still up? it keeps timing out for me
I use it for irc, remember?
curiosity question: why is it down?
ok
oof
welp guess I'll use this then
also commandz, what did you mean by everybody?
lol
I kinda expect the same would happen to mine if it happened to go down, but in that case I would have no control over it and would have to wait for it to fix 
idiotic question: how do I open the menu on Jetpack Joyride CE?
nvm, found it, it's del
finally got reconnected
so how've y'alls days been?
I'm sorry what?
my brain just stops working whenever I look at these logs.
what version of cesium will work on a 5.3 os in cemu?
The most recent version just keeps causing cemu to reset the calc when run
:/ which version (if any) will work in cemu?
boot version?
brb
the calc I have a rom of is 5.3.0.0037
5.1.5.0014
opening the program
as soon as I open the program the clac ram resets
app is not there
idk, let me try
If cesium is in archive - yesyes, not in archive -
do I need to asm( it?
ok
both in and out of archive after a full reset it crashes
I tink so?
* can't spell
"You already have the latest CEmu version (v1.3)"
for all I know maybe, lol
:|
should I use the "development" build here? https://ce-programming.github.io/CEmu/download
ok
I love errors
Error Failed to detect the latest folder. (Current path: /oss-snapshot-local/org/github/CE-Programming/CEmu/git/) You may need to refresh this page in order 
refreshing did nothing
thanks womp
curiosity question- why was it called CEmu-USB?
ok
should I try to update the image to 5.4?
ok
ah
ok
and now it works, lol
yep
something must have gotten corrupted on this image when I pulled it off the calc, there's a 13 byte program called "B" on here that crashes when run
nope
I don't even have one that small
nope
nor did I have one that small
also, said program is edit protected
CEmu flags it as "Prot. Prog. (ASM)"
gets hit by duck
is it the other slash?
\me test
the slash and backslash, I call both slashes slash
just looking through calc contents in CEmu... theres a program called 01 that is nowhere to be found on the actual calc, with the code "Asm84CEPrgmC7" what is 
whatever it is, it's chilling in my archive
lol I had an actual image ages back, but didn't have said image backed up apparently and it was lost
Haven't had a chance to re-get one and as such have used one off of internet
...
Is it really piracy/copyright infingement if I already had a rom but lost it?
did not have it backed up, and the computer I had the rom on I no longer have access to
clearly /me commands no longer work in any capacity in sax because womp just used /me but the message looked odd in sax
"/me [D] [mr womp womp] runs"
... CEmu just froze
great. I think I'mma have to reload the rom.
the calc just won't respond
I tried to use cesium to invert colors and it froze
/stopped responding
tries to put jetpack joyride on my CEmu calc
CEmu: I'm not going to send "LibLoad" what were you thinking?
someone please help
brb, sorry
back
is there a scenario CEmu can get itself into where it can't send files?
It refuses to send libload
through drag drop or the send button
nope, bar fills and then vanishes
nope
that finished fine, but it still won't send libload...
lemme check
2826K
windows can't rename it bc the file is open
yes, bc CEmu has it open apparently
sending other parts of Jetpack Joride is fine, it's just libload
I'm just sending libload
it said cannot rename bc it's open in CEmu
restarted
I can rename it now
trying send
nothing
I just downloaded the latest release of dub's jetpack joyride, the downloaded clibs off the cemetech post
1 sec, trying just sending clibs rather than just libload
^that did it
???
it was the one dub linked
also would ti 84+ programs (ie: the amogus) work on the CE?
near the end of the thread
https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=297358#297358
this is what I meant by amogus: https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=17589
I love when I get bugs others can't replicate
bc CEmu won't send AMOGUS now...
whatever.
huh?
oh, you mean the one womp sent me yesterday that I'm using rn?
:|
...
ticket reopened: not working as intended on my machine
new ticket: cannot send AMOGUS to CEmu | Evidence: REDACTED_GD_LINK
like why is it where it is?
bc I have math I'm supposed to be doing on most of the screen
I have all of it in a backup folder on my computer
and I tried to send it. What else could I have done?
?
yes, that's why I didn't send the 8xi
womp: bc life hates me
anyways, gonna log off for the day, bye all
one last thing though, is there a ay to override CEmu so it saves everything to a folder and nothing in appdata?
I can't spell
ok
planning on sticking it on a usb drive, should have remembered it had a portable option
love faulty antivirus
called CEmu suspicous after I copied it
but not before
???
but it was fine as portable before copy
and it hasn't flagged any other portable app I've used
so..?
anyways, I do need to go, bye!
I've been off for a while, what'd I miss?
uhm...
10 days, judging by the last mention I have from a conversation I was in.
:? lol
...
i love it when shift doesn't work
i mean
that's *technically* not true
someone somewhere probably died
lol
always interesting when I have mentions that have nothing to do with me :P
I'm back!
Hey LifeEmu, what'cha talking about? (client disconned me on the 27th so I have no scollback)
I've been off for a while
does the cse not have a wait command?
SGTMM gimme a min I'll build a demo for you
(assuming I can mentally process life)
gimme a min
interesting note: cemetech didn't flag the first one as a mention
I'mma still make a sample.
lol
yep :P
It'll mostly be demo code, so It'll shuffle to a list and then spit them out one by one
gimme a min while I figure out how dim works, lol
nope
... well, that did the opposite of what I wanted it to do...
time to fix that.
what does seq do..?
trying to figure out the best way to get x element, I'm probably overlooking an easier way, lol
...so many functions...
Hello
I'm back
time to go back to working on the sample program
I lost internet for a bit, and browser force reloaded
I'm back to it now
What's M?
..?
what?
what is "m"
uhh?
ok I'mma just stop questioning this now...
does M^2 equal the same thing?
fghsgh I've never seen a calc do that before
gets hit by a duck
why.
grabs the duck and throws it at Caesar
learned something interesting about some software on my computer just now: Cemetech.net is not blocked but ceme.tech is.
-\(:/)/-
wavejumper: I'm actually talking about norton family, lol
what's the triangle list function... thing called?
it shows a triangle the list
yes that
that's why I needed it
it removes the first thing from a list when you combine them, right?
???
so which way?
ok then
uhm...
why does transfering a program named "BLACKJACK" to a cse become "(up arrow)AJAC"???
ok
hmm even the word "BLACK" becomes "🔼C"
Up arrow
filled in
also said bugged out programs cannot be run
you just can't select them
(I'm using sourcecoder)
http://sc.cemetech.net/?hash=gpQlWeV68xInZ3x3a01dldN6immt
that work?
Get the first element
probably a better way isn't there
lol
of course, it's that easy, lol
lol
hmm
might have just found something, gimme a min
It won't do it anymore?
???
weird
I can no longer replicate the bug
???
wait...
It's also only a bug if it's a 84+CSE/84+CE Basic file, wont happen with 83+/84+
Strange
also, note the K's getting removed from the name
but why is the name "(arrow)CJAC"?
where'd the K in black go?
hmm
but the name "BLACJACK" Is fine.
weird
"\BLACKJACK" still becomes the same thing
fun fact: if it's the only program the calc is forced to select it and replaces the arrow with a ? when trying to run it
yes actually
that works
although now I have to deal with the name being too long
gets hit by duck
hits Zeroko with the duck
I'm gonna go with "BLAC\KJCK"
maybe
we'll see
it's just a demo anyways
uhh
found a way to break it agin, lol
sending a file named "?JACK" to the calc just freaks jstified out
lol
hmm the cal turns the ? into some weird U
and then therefore can't run it
butanyways
( I can't tye today)
rgh
*type
anyways, here's your demo SGTMM: http://sc.cemetech.net/?hash=O4nQ4sQuZRw3eC3et6TAoXY+n/G0
yep!
lol
Gosh dangit
gimme a min
hang on just a minute I've got one more idea
actaully that's better than the idea I had, lol
grabs 10 ducks and smacks Caesar with them
ah nice. that's a highlight.
don't question why I used 1-52. I just did.
k
I didn't even consciously do it
what?
yay! more fucntions I've never used
Also, it was just a proof of concept kinda thing
another Fun Fact about sourcecoder's bug, displaying the string "BLACKJACK" through a Disp command is fine
also, leaving just the word "BLACK" in the code is fine
it seems to only replace it if it's the name
weird.
SGTMM: cool! hope your game turns out great!
ooh! how do I change it?
ok!
oh. fun.
..? I broke sourcecoder by opening the catalog?
*jstified
Zeroko: where?
oh weird
it just froze after loading one menu item in the catalog, I had to keep clicking play
I don't think so?
cse
wasn't doing it untill just now
hmm must have suto set one, bc hitting clear all fixed it
*auto
... how do I do that?
lol
ah ok
LogicalJoe++
boop
lol
!karma LogicalJoe
I feel like I'm a terrible person if I have that low compared to you
lets see

oops
there have been 6 quotes this year so far
I don't know why i counted that
I tried to make an irc bot, but it refuses to connect to efnet, it always ends up timing out
I edited a pre-made python script
lemme go grab it, (it currently connects to #random on chat.freenode.net since I couldn't get it to work on here)
dug it up, here's the bot: https://replit.com/@Firepup650/Bot
...
that's a lot of essages
*messages
~ninja'd
ok, bot's online
?
Error bars?
Also, who should I ask to get my usernames linked on https://decbot.cemetech.net/ ?
Mateo's an admin right? (I'm tired and can't mentally process right now, lol)
?
So kerm then?
...
~sleep
lol
I haven't slept well in what feels like weeks
Working on sleeping? That almost sounds counterintuitive (at least to me)!
Presumably?
Just randomly decided to look up sleeping on Google, I lightly regret it now due to a news article for that search
Curiosity question: what happens if there are no ops in a irc channel?
Ah ok
Got it
Lemme just go op a user from the Random Corporation
Huh?
Who was it who I told a while back that their real name according to irc, was purple?
There's your motivation, shower so you can wear your favorite hoodie
This cat is insane, lol
I think it was zeroko, but I'm not sure
Ok
I saw that
Is there ever an instance where this chat is on topic for more than 10 minutes (if that)? Lol
Then again, what is on-topic
Ah ok
I don't feel like we're on topic for more than around 10 minutes at a time without someone going off topic, lol
(in this scenario referring to like calc programming and such)
ThuberPhD: same
What is this cat doing? https://commandblockguy.xyz/irc/uploads/b527f6d5321bcca9/16517933849828908501982948991122.jpg 
Not what I meant, she moved before I could get a picture of what she was doing
She was attacking my bathroom door
(also in the picture I have no clue what she's staring at, but she is standing on top of a toilet paper tube that she's been playing with)
I don't know, but it's the second time she's attacked it within 20ish minutes
And this cat was trying to eat my chair:  https://commandblockguy.xyz/irc/uploads/e45249cabf438eef/16517936090937999064574163927448.jpg 
What?
Maybe???
I got bored today, so I added a bunch of things to my main AutoHotKey script
You mean imgur?
Not imagur?
Nikkybot no one was talking to you!
What projects have y'all been working on?
I always do too many things at one time (ie: currently working on an irc chat bot, a discord chat bot, some AutoHotKey stuff, etc.)
lol
I don't task switch effectively either
I'll be half way making a new command for the discord one, and then jump onto the irc one for a bit, and at least 10% of that time I spent on AutoHotKey

Good morning all!
Which version (java or bedrock) is the cemetech mc server?
Of course, lol
Time to figure out how to get a bedrock client on a java sever, lol
Hmm
Why are there 4 dimensions?
Ok
From what I can tell, is it missing a world border?
memmgmtrw?
memmgmtrw (mem-memory,mgmt-management,rw-rewrite)
?
You're welcome 😄
?
No, like the rest of what you were saying
Like the framebuffer stuff
I think I might have just found a way to bring my ircbot onto efnet finally.
Trying to connect it to irc.efnet.net always times out
But I think efnet.port80.se (based on testing I just did) could work
Time to try
... and it gets banned???
What the...
Does port80 have some rule against bots connecting to it?
I don't know
Looking at the log, the last message before it got banned was the MoTD
But on my irc client, it sends a "CTCP Request: VERSION"
I don't know. I'll just try another server I guess.
Yep, nope I guess whatever efnet.port80.se did banned it from all of them?
...hmm
So... Is it the hostname of the bot that's bad?
Bc if I use it's nick to connect to efnet.port80.se, it's fine
irc.choopa.net says the bot's "K-lined"
efnet.port80.se says the bot's "Temporary D-Line 1400 min"
I think I finally stabilized it
Thank you irc.mzima.net
I should probably make sure bot's functional though
lol
How many CE's are you getting womp?
Protosw?
Ah
Ok
Cool 👍
I'm back
I like monospace
If you don't own it why should you be able to copyright it?
I own the universe, lol
Random question (to everyone): what's your favorite font?
MateoC: don't you hate it when auto correct thinks it's better than you?
Lol
...
I use Courier New, because it was the first monospace one I came across, and I didn't bother changing
after I found it
The world: *puts everything in light theme by default* Me: I hate light themes
Il1|
Hey Caesar
?
Hmm
Night tr1p1ea!
lol
But hey, you've got a possible is with it
Is there a rule in this copyright/warranty/whatever, that says you can't send it to someone else without also sending them the copyright/warranty/whatever?
Hmm, what if you don't copy it (ie: "cutting" the program)
Hmm
Why are CE's so expensive?
Eh, true
Adriweb: around $100, but I remember one being like $300 once 
Hi
I'm frustrated at a freaking ircbot rn, I'll be back later once I've calmed down
It worked fine on one channel
And somethings still work on multichannel
But most of it is broken for multichannel
DJ Omnimaga, commandz, I have a way to connect it to efnet, I found a server that lets it through
The issue is that when it's connected to more than one channel, the bot's "owner" commands break
And all's it's doing is running a check that goes: "Is username in the admin list?" And if the answer is yes then it executes the command
Wavejumper3 what?
commandz it's here: https://repl.it/@Firepup650/Bot
lol
On the topic of my bot for a second, the only thing that doesn't work is the command to tell the bot to leave
Nikkybot Zeroko more like
??? lol
A side note: there's a small bug with it, if you open that topic and check the top of the page, there's this: "/>
It is advanced by 0 years
Does it run asm?
Or any ce programs/apps?
He probably asked?
👋 wavejumper3
lol
So why does lol become 0x5 in a post?
LogicalJoe you on? There's (I think) issues in the last of your demos. (Time to double check)
...
What?
LogicalJoe: I apologize, it's not broken, just looked weird to me
Also Welcome back LifeEmu!
I'mma work on my bot for a bit, if you need me I'll be in random
...
This is fun to read through: http://www.efnet.org/?module=docs&doc=12
LifeEmu you didn't know about slash commands?
LifeEmu: I see
Wavejumper3 Hello!
wavejumper3: how's your day been so far?
why's that?
ah rain. always ruining everyone's day.
My day's actually been better (at least in terms of coding) then the last few days so far
i mean... *technically* you could
it just wouldn't be good for the calculators
LifeWmu off. what happened?
autocorrect!!!
lol
plastic wrap them, or put them in a plastic bag
justuse plastic bags, then they are sade from rain
when my autocorrdct works it sucks, but when it doesn't work it also sucks.
i misstype auto as stuo a lot
a and s are beside eachother on keyboard
not usually
but it is the reason why i have 2 email adresses
"firepyp" and "firepup"
LifeEmu possible sutocorrect?
eh, you forgot to capitalize "Even" wave
lol
If I tupe a messahe wirjoir lookind I hey rjis
yeah, my typing does kinda suck
...
ok
CAPITALIZATION
Please wave, use capitalization
...
lol
Hey, I'm the one who misspelt their email when I got it
This messaged wAzs tgyped with my bnose.
...
?
Zeroko: should we go to a different channel then?
true...
time for a different channel I guess, so here you go #Spelling
It wants to
time to attempt to make my bot remember if a user has been in a certain channel before or not
My bot's function is to chill and respond to certain things
(ie: .tell, sudo, op, being given op, etc.)
also, welcoming newcomers to it's channel
*channel(s)
I'm currently testing it in #random and #dice.
I made the channels
feel free to test there as well!
Sure!
Side note dice is "intended" for rolling dice, but It hasn't been that way, pretty much because no one was there
yes
gimme a min to try something...
wave: try this http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?nick=wavejumper&channels=%23random%2C+%23dice&Login=Login
When making the url through efnet, it wouldn't let me put the 3
I also forgot what the limit was
yeah...
idk
here. this one (should) work
http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?nick=wavejump3&channels=%23random%2C+%23dice&Login=Login
nikkybot I wasn't even talking
nikkybot my bot?
ok then.
Whoo!
My bot is (hopefully) finally stabalized.
Wavejumper3: it looks like you got your bot re-fixed
Side note: maybe have the bot lower case the message before handling it? (So you don't have to worry about capitalization)
Translating "TI-317 CSE" please wait...
Translation complete! Result: "Potatobot doesn't exist."

Please confirm Result.
Or deconfirm result

Zeroko: acknoledged
(tatertommorow is casear right?)
ok
any other names tuber uses?
I just need names he uses to feed into the bot as admin names
lol
for now I'll use tatertommorow and tuberphd as the admin names, and add more later if needbe
I think I remeber seeing that somewhere
I saw it on his cemetech signature
although it doesn't mention yesterday

11:01 PM or 23:01?
(preference question)
I mean do you use 12 or 24 hour time?
I just don't like 12 hour
Zeroko: same, lol
commandz: right?
who came up with 12 hour time anyways?
that's a website?
hmm
really?
I want to see where this is from
you sure? isn't it efnet.port80.se?
lol
All's I know rn
is irc.mzima.net is good for bots
I'm tired
and should probably sleep, but oh well
g'night cemetechians
I'll prob be up in like 3-4 houre
Use 587 e's
I mean, you can't really make people read something a certain way
pgrmEEP or pgrmMEEP
So wait. That doesn't work kg
Because then you could expand it to "EEP Engine Program Engine Program"

Why do these exist?
People named "JACK" are an acronym, lol
I like this one: XNA's Not Acronymed
But if that's the acronym for it, then it is acronymed

And bash
No
Just... No
I'mma go eat breakfast
Imagine
I love it when things only semi-work
Ie: both the ircbots I'm making will (sort of) stay online by being pinged, but a discord bot won't
(by sort of I mean they randomly disconnect, and then reconnect a maximum of 5 minutes later)
On that side note: I'm working on Potatobot rn
Debating adding a feature to it and FireBot that will cause them to argue for a bit
...
Cool
I mean, a user would have to trigger it...
But I could also channel lock the command
Ie: it would not be allowed to run in certain channels
I do need to make sure at some point that the code I made for them handles sax properly
It should work, but there are lots of thing that should work, and then don't.
On a similar note: what is the best way to contact an admin? Through email, cemetech's inbox thing, or a different way?
Ok
Clearly chrome is responding or I wouldn't be able to send a message
Zeroko: The OS did (I'm on Android 8(also technically "Process Maganer" I think it's called, but it is a system app)(I'm a bit late, but I'm still here))
I only learned it's name when it stopped responding as well yesterday and had to restart to remove a frozen pop-up that said chrome isn't responding.
Don't you love it when the "not responding" pop-up stops responding?
..?
If you're on chrome you could also try loading a cache page
Wave: you still have the link to irc I made for you right?
I have 2 of those
One of them's Nintendo branded, and the other's Samsung branded
Off-topic note: Tuber, what should Potatobot do?
Because I'm making it?
Why else?
oh dear
TuberPhD: What should potatobot do?
(if you don't give me anything to go off, I'l just make something, make sure it works, and call it good.)
?
^
...
People on discord can hear me right?
just checking
fuggy: I mean you're on discord so...
I'm going to assume tuber's ignoring me for some reason
ok
?
oof
Hi starving I'm Firepup
...
I'mma change my nick for a min to test a bot feature, be back
night Caesar
found the bug
forgot to put !=-1 on a line
~feed DecBot3
we tried at least
Ok goo
I was worried
Port80 just decided to ban the client I was using
Hey LifeEmu
I'm more than a little frustrated rn
Not at you
Just...
I need to rant for a bit
LifeEmu: it said you joined the channel
lol, nope
I think the only way to pull that one off is to use discord
I'm frustrated/mad, for 2 reasons rn
1. efnet.port80.se auto-bans bots on join
How it detects them? I have no clue
2. Upon resetting my username in my usual client, efnet.port80.se turns around and bans me!
(I had changed it for bot testing purposes)
Yeah I probably will, it's just annoying
And it's reasoning for this ban?
"Temporary D-Line (14400 mins)"
That's the only reason I got
Ugh
Hey at least I knew a different server to try
I'm using this one for my bots as well
The only thing I saw in the MoTD for this one about bots was that there fine for server moderation, but abusive ones are bad
LifeEmu: no, I switched back to my normal one, under a different server
Efnet has a lot of servers
http://www.efnet.org/?module=servers
I used to just connect to irc.efnet.net, but connecting to individual servers produces much faster load times
Fun fact I just learned
Google doesn't care to put my website in the search results, even if you outright search for the url
Yet duckduckgo has no issues with it
LifeEmu: that actually the right address, at least according to the list
Which I'm going to assume is up to date and correct
Side note: if you search for my username in Google, you'll get everyone but my website
In duckduckgo it's the second result
Google. How hard is it to add a website. That literally has the search term in the name, to the search results?
I mean
I have everything on my end set up
It's literally linked on both cemetech and replit
Searching for my website will show you everywhere I've posted it somewhere
But the site itself won't be in your results
Google has 9 results for my website
But yet
The site is not in the list
Lemme go pull up the dashboard and be reminded why Google hasn't listed in the results yet
We have 2 pages that Google has said "yep. These links are fine" there's /null and /contact
The homepage isn't okay of crying out loud
13 of them have been looked at and Google went: "these are intentionally not indexed"
Then 2 of the sitemaps are apparently returning errors right now?
commandz hi
commandz did efnet.port80.se kick you too?
commandz I wondered about it bc it decided to ban me
it did it after I changed my nick, is there a limit on how many times you can change it in X period of time?
my log shows 4:33 as the ban time
but that could be timezones
let's see in UTC it would have been... around 23:33
commandz by your logs, which of my bots is more stable?
ie: doesn't leave as much
megagigs
lol
boop
curiosity question: are "firepup" and "Firepup" different nicks according to irc or no?
ok, just checking for the sake of my bots' security
I wouldn't want random people having full bot control
DJ: why were you a walrus?
yes
true
but how else am I going to do it?
true
how would a password system work though
But you see
Anyone can look at the bot's source code and find the password
Curiosity question: how would I go about linking a channel to a discord server?
(I need to test some bot funtions
)
You know what: better idea (easier idea) log in with another account onto the testing channel and test that way
saxjax is orangish red
Zeroko: yours is pink to me
I'm cyan, which is my fave color so...
Yay
DoorsCS is purple
commandz is a lime-ish color
fghsgh is... Tannish pink
That's what I wrot
*wrote
Ugh
You know what. That's a feature of FireBot not
*nownmnn
Rgh
*now
I mean, FireBot's in a testing channel rn, so it's not going to hurt anyone
We'll see if it stays
Be back
E
Anyways, got stuff I need to do
Hello
I'm backing up 15.4 GiB of files
Yeah uhm
Multi-lone code doesn't work well on irc end
So how long do y'all think this will *actually* take to complete?
ETA's anyone? https://commandblockguy.xyz/irc/uploads/8cd77284f9263a4e/Screenshot_20220509-215211.png 
Can you try making it on the calc, copying it off, then putting it back on?
...
Wow. The file transfer I've got running can't pick a time to be done, it's 18h to completion now
21hs
...
Maybe I'll make this a couple smaller transfers, and not one big one
3 hours to copy 14 files, great, this bodes well...
MateoC: what's the longest you've had to wait on a small number of files to upload
lol
Uhm
Let's see
The 14 files have a total size of 2.0 GiB
Yes
According to my file explorer
Yeah, my internet usually sucks
Sadly, I think my school gets better bandwidth
I canceled the 102 file upload as the eta got so high it disappeared
Current eta on the smaller one
2:10:24
Would a VPN help, hinder, or do nothing in this situation?
My upload is very low:  https://commandblockguy.xyz/irc/uploads/1b03c6408860aa38/Screenshot_20220509-220908.png 
4.8 upload
85.3 download
Internet is bad for uploads
I guess?
?
...
What's your download bandwidth then?
Also it just looked really low compared to the upload speed
I'm falling asleep over here
Stop falling asleep me!
Ok fine fine you kwin
Night cemetech!
Who/what is haxjax (no that's not a typo)
I know all about not being able to run things
Both my computer and phone suck
I mean, the computer's a laptop, so it has an excuse
The phone though
I've found phones older than mine that run more games than it can, and at better quality
Morning
Why not not?
My bots are dead
One of the modules I was using for user recognition/remberence has an error that breaks everything now
LifeEmu nothing I did broke it
The code hasn't changed since yesterday
At which point it was working
They died shortly after 6 yesterday
Hey ceasar
LifeEmu I don't know
Maybe the module got updated?
Whatever werkzeug.local is doesn't exist
LifeEmu, I can (probably) work around it, it's just going to be more annyoing
Truthfully, I don't think Potatobot needs it, as it didn't even use it
So I'll go apply a patch to Potatobot for now
(ie: try to import it, but if there's an error ignore it)
PotatoBot is a bot I'm making in response to someone talking to a nonexistent bot named Potatobot yesterday
Or day before, I don't knwo
I'd probably end up making a bot with that name.
I mean, I basically have a template to use so...
No.
Just, no
I just ate some watermelon rasins
...
https://commandblockguy.xyz/irc/uploads/c8fb7b52dcde7a75/16521999712617779169594984726169.jpg 
LifeEmu it is?
Also I think the bot just hasn't tried to reinstall anything, bc flask is also not working after bypassing the werkzeug error
And I need flask
Time to try another bypass
And that failed
"expected string or bytes-like object"
ugh
LifeEmu ?
Oh also, here's the error when I try to manually install the stuff it needs to work https://commandblockguy.xyz/irc/uploads/98d4de1f1135906a/Screenshot_20220510-113448.png 
LifeEmu I'm using python
I have one last trick up my sleeve
Install everything it needs one by one
Beep Boop, Boop Beep
Rgh
Why?
"ImportError: cannot import name 'Flask' from 'flask' (unknown location)"
Apparently flask is missing some metadata?
"ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/runner/PotatoBot/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/Flask-2.1.2.dist-info/
I'mma have to manually delete and reinstall it I think
I think that fixed flask, but now click is broken
Now jinja2's broken
Oml finally reset
A bunch of modules were missing some metadata, and I had to delete them to get pip to update them
Now I have to do it all again...
For FireBot
There.
Bots should be up shortly
I'mma make a script to fix this in the future
Dang it.
The script removed all packages bc I ran it with an empty parameter by accident
I love when a website doesn't say "1 second ago" and instead says "774 milliseconds ago" [no sarcasm]
Accuracy is nice
Also, I hate when things say "just now"
Oh dang itAnd done
Hello, lol I was testing a command
planning on leaving these open, maybe I'll ask to get nikkybot back in here as well to add to the randomness I hope to happen here
nikkybot what would you do if I made you an admin?
nikkybot that doesn't answer the question.
..?
commandz: a reop please?
thanks
is there a bot that's easy to set up that I could add to this channel to reop me if I leave and rejoin?
hmm lemme try something...
commandz: a reop please?
thank you
back on
commandz?
thank you
why does it keep disconnecting me?
timeout?
hey commandz been a while hasn't it?
That took too long
Time to try something
op Firepup
Hmm
That's a bug
Commandz, please reop FireBot and not me temporarily, I'm testing something
Uh
That's also a bug
Hmm
Nvm, gimme a min
Ok
Commandz, please op FireBot
Dang it, it crashed
Ok...
I think that should auto reop me from now on
Nvm, that won't work.
Efnet doesn't support w
Thanks commandz
Op
Ok!
Op
cycle
Oops
Ok, works so far
I do need to fix the bug where you can send any message containing o and p (ie: oops) and it ops you
goodbye FireBot
nikkybot when did you leave
uh
ok
bye firebot
bye firebot
uh...
that's a bug right there.
commandz, please reop me I forgot to reop the bot before I reset my connection to try to connect to efnet.poort80.se securely
speaking of which, what port/server combonation are you using to be securely connected?
hello
it seems irc trimmed the username
What do you mean?
like to connect a bot to the channel?
idk, I write in python (ie here: repl.it/@Firepup650/Bot)
Yeah... I don't know how to help you there, sorry
ok
wavejumpe: this might help https://davidwalsh.name/nodejs-irc
hello suzan (assuming this is your bot wavejume)
*wavejumpe
bye suzan, lol
wavejumpe, a side note: the client you are using CANNOT join cemetech
apparently some people used that client to spam cemetech or something
another case of the few ruin it for the many
if you want to change your nickname, do it like this:
./nick newnick
without the "." of course
if you want to see other commands to try "/help"
also "/help command" works as well
oh that's gonna confuse me, lol
look how close the color my client picked for your nick is to mine https://commandblockguy.xyz/irc/uploads/8984cb979dca50f1/Screenshot_20220507-095508.png
lemme bring my bot up again
I'm in the middle of adding user remberence, so he might act a little odd.
Hi FireBot!
I probably should give him a help command
He didn't crash, just not programmed to respond to that
also wavejump3: you can use /me
nice.
suzan
hey, at least FireBot worked.
can I see code?
I want to see if I can find issue
yeeeeeeeeeeees?
lol
uh?
so wait would...
ACTION test
nope
weird
try decoding it as utf-8?
also remove all \n\r's
(newlines and returns)
can you paste here what you bot gets from a message?
*your
suzan hello
ok
ok?
can I see what it's giving you?
houston we have a response!
lol
hmm
hello suzan
why suzan (out of curiosity?)
ok
suzan How are you?
hey, it can read messages now, just gotta get it's commands working
suzan I'm good
uh?
suzan
suzan
suzan 
suzan a
suzan what are computer years?
...
suzan I'm listening
ok
me too actually
dangit.
gimme a bit
Something in my "has a user joined before" code
"NoneType is not iterable"
the heck
I think I know the issue
this doesn't work "key=key.append(chan)" this does (I think) "key.append(chan)" 
and 2
uhm
no.
and now somehow it's always firing the help command
well that's one bug fixed
time to make sure welcome messages work
nope.
hi
it's hi firebot or hello firebot
yes, hi
ok 1 sec need to reset firebot
Test time!
ok, but does it work for multi channel
Yes it does!
bye firebot
ok!
There goes wave
Hey thanks commandz
and...
That fixes the issue where I had to help it restart
whoo!
uh
why?
...
lol it sent it to "random" not "#random"
Wow. Timing
alright
║║╦\n╠╣║\n║║╩
commandz, the bot will (from here on out) consider you an op
yep
(that is when the bot stays online)
which it doesn't, most of the time
another note commandz if you've been deop'd but the bot pp
try it now!
hmm
that works
op me
there, lol
wait... my nick is wrong
DJ_Omnima when'd you get here?
...
Case sensitive? I made that mistake
Ok
Read error...
@commandz you have long logs right?
Could I get a copy of my messages?
Thanks
